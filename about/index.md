On this blog I post about software development related topics that have my attention.

I'm working as a software architect for Luminis Technologies, where I'm currently leading the team that develops [Cloud RTI](https://cloud-rti.com); a Kubernetes based service that takes care of DevOps tasks like blue/green deployment, failover, centralised logging and monitoring. 

I'm the author of “Building Modular Cloud Apps With OSGi” published by O'Reilly and an advocate for modularity in software. Currently I'm co-authoring my second book for O'Reilly "Java 9 Modularity" which is scheduled to be published early 2017. 

I love speaking at tech conferences. Want me to speak at your conference? Feel free to contact me.
