On this blog I post about software development related topics that have my attention.

I'm working as a software architect at Luminis Technologies, based in the Netherlands. My work is mostly about product development, working on innovative technolgy. OSGi has been a key technologie in the past few years, which resulted in publishing "Modular Cloud Apps with OSGi" with O'Reilly. A lot of my work has been spent contributing to [Amdatu](http://amdatu.org), an open source project focussed at creating great OSGi components, and making OSGi the best tool for building "cloud" applications. 

Currently a lot of my focus is towards improving cloud infrastructure, which includes Docker, Kubernetes and building on top of these tools.

I love speaking at tech conferences. Want me to speak at your conference? Feel free to contact me.
