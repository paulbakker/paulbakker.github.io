I wrote an extensive OSGi / Amdatu [tutorial](http://amdatu.org/tutorial/intro.html) that covers all the topics that you need to build modular (web) applications. The tutorial should be a deep-dive introduction in the concepts, tools and libraries that you need, and should fast track you to developing real applications. 

Topics include: 

* Bundles and module boundaries
* OSGi services
* RESTful web services with JAX-RS
* Unit and integration testing
* Incorporating JavaScript (AngularJS) front ends
* Using MongoDB
* JPA
* Scheduled tasks
* Configuration with Managed Services
* Building with Gradle
* Docker deployment

The tutorial comes with a git repository that you can use for each step if you get stuck. But of course also feel free to [ask questions](http://amdatu.org/mailinglist.html)!
Also, we already had a large collection of videos that cover many of these topics (and more), so [have a look](http://amdatu.org/index.html) at those as well.
