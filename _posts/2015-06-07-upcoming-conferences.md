The next few weeks are going to be busy again. This week I will be speaking at [InfoShare](https://infoshare.pl), giving a talk *"10 reasons to use OSGi for your next Cloud App"* and a three hour tutorial about OSGi, Amdatu and modularity.

This is the first time I will be speaking at InfoShare, and I'm expecting it's going to be an interesting week. Besides technical content I'm also curious about the startup scene at the conference; they seem to be having a _lot_ going on.


Next up will be at [DevNation](http://devnation.org) where I will have two talks. I will co-present *"Provisioning the IoT"* with Sander Mak, where we will discuss [Apache ACE](http://ace.apache.org) as a provisioning solution for the IoT. I will also present *"Kubernetes - Beyond the basics"* where I will go into my current work which is about building production ready deployment environments based on Kubernetes. I will go into load balancing, automated deployments, blue/green deployment and a lot more, so if you're looking at Kubernets, this should be interesting. DevNation was great last year, with a lot of deep technical content from a wide variaty of speakers, so I'm really looking forward to this one.
